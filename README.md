Greetings and welcome!  
I'm Ishtiaque Ahmed, a **full-time Mathematics Teacher** at the Senior Section of an English Medium Islamic School.  
When I'm not immersed in the world of numbers and equations, I wear different hats as a **part-time web developer**, crafting digital landscapes, and a **part-time freelance businessman**, navigating the ebb and flow of opportunities.   
Amidst these responsibilities, I also find joy in the art of **storytelling** during my moments of leisure.
